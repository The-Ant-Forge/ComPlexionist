[paths]

# Use when Plex server file paths differ from your local network paths
# For example, if Plex stores paths like \volume1\video\Movies\...
# but you access them via \\Storage4\video\Movies\...

# The path prefix as stored by Plex server (usually starts with single backslash)
# plex_prefix = \volume1\Path-to-video

# The corresponding local network path prefix (UNC paths start with \\)
# local_prefix = \\Remote\Path-to-video
