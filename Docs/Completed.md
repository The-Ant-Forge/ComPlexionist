## Project Setup and Documentation (2025-01-24)

**Why:** Establish project foundation with research and documentation before implementation.

**What we did:**
- Created `README.md` with project overview and feature descriptions
- Created `Docs/Plex-Background.md` with comprehensive Plex API research:
  - Authentication methods (X-Plex-Token, JWT, PIN flow)
  - Library architecture and content separation
  - Collections API and the "missing movies" problem
  - TV show hierarchy (Show > Season > Episode)
  - External data sources (TMDB for movies, TVDB for TV)
  - python-plexapi library overview
- Created `Docs/TODO.md` with development task breakdown
- Adapted `agents.md` from TVRenamer project for ComPlexionist workflow

**Key files:**
- `README.md`
- `Docs/Plex-Background.md`
- `Docs/TODO.md`
- `agents.md`
